# City Statistic

#### About
This is the backend side of our first spring boot application. During this project we met with spring security and also with JWT token validation.
Also this project consists of two parts, a backend side where we use Java enterprise, Spring boot & a frontend side where we used React. [Link to frontend repository](https://github.com/CodecoolGlobal/city-statistic-react)
